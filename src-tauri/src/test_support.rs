//! Test-only construction helpers shared by this crate's unit tests and by the
//! integration tests under `src-tauri/tests/`.
//!
//! This module is `pub` rather than `#[cfg(test)]` on purpose: integration
//! tests are separate crates and cannot see a library's `#[cfg(test)]` items,
//! so a gated module could not serve them. It is `#[doc(hidden)]` and must not
//! be referenced from any production code path.

/// A `tauri::Builder` that tests can `build()` off the main thread wherever the
/// platform allows it.
///
/// `Builder::any_thread` is declared `#[cfg(any(windows, target_os = "linux"))]`
/// in Tauri (`tauri-2.10.3/src/app.rs:1503`): macOS requires the event loop on
/// the main thread, so the method is not exposed there. Tests that only need a
/// built `App` still compile on macOS; only the off-main-thread relaxation is
/// unavailable.
